### Design Methodology

Our UIkit library is primarily based on the principles of [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/). This methodology emphasizes building UI components from the ground up, starting with small, independent elementsâ€”referred to as _atoms_.

These atoms are then composed into more complex, reusable structures known as _molecules_ and beyond, promoting scalability, consistency, and modularity throughout the design system.
