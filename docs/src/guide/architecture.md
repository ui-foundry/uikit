# Architecture

Stencil takes features such as

- Virtual DOM
- Async rendering
- Reactive data-binding
- TypeScript
- JSX
- Static Site Generation (SSG)

and then generates **standards-based** Web Components and web apps with these features baked in.

Except Stencil, our library doesn't have any other dependency. Even no CSS framework! Therefore, it
is very lightweight and doesn't bloat your application.
