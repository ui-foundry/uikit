### Introduction

The **UIkit Library** is an open-source project focused on building modern web applications. It is developed in alignment with the UI Foundry styling guidelines to ensure a consistent and unified user interface across all components.


Our technology stack is built on established web standards and industry best practices. Simplicity and developer experience are key guiding principles in our technical decisions. To align with these goals, we have adopted [Web Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components) as the foundation of our UI architecture. UIkit Library are natively supported by all major modern browsers, ensuring broad compatibility and reducing dependency overhead.

Additionally, the project is developed with full support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), enabling static type checking, improved developer tooling, and greater maintainability of the codebase.
