# Architecture

Our Component Library is built using **Stencil**, a powerful compiler that generates **standards-based Web Components**â€”specifically, **Custom Elements**â€”optimized for high-performance web applications.

Stencil brings together the best concepts from popular frameworks into a simple, build-time tool. The result is clean, framework-agnostic JavaScript and CSS, with no runtime dependencies.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features of Stencil

- Virtual DOM
- Asynchronous rendering
- Reactive data-binding
- TypeScript support
- JSX syntax
- Static Site Generation (SSG)

Thanks to **output targets**, our components can be easily integrated into all major frameworks with minimal effort.

### âš¡ Lightweight by Design

Our library has **no dependencies** beyond Stencil itselfâ€”**not even a CSS framework**. This makes it extremely **lightweight** and ensures it won't bloat your application.
